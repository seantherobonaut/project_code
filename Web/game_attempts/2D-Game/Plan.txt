So here's the plan...

Make a 2D game the player as a square can move around the screen and not go off the edge

Canvas

Entity
    Mesh
    Movement






Modify the game so the player can shoot bullets at stationary targets and make them vanish

Modify the targets so they can follow the player and touch kills player

Modify targets so they can shoot back

Modify game so all entities have health,
