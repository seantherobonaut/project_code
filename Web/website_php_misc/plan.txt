    //LEARN php headers header($_SERVER["SERVER_PROTOCOL"]." 404 Not Found", true, 404)
    //LEARN http responses http_response_code(404)

    //TODO prevent any output with the output buffer... actualy does output buffer flush if there's an error anyway?

    //NOTE outputting php plain text before the header (doctype and document stuff) creates a lag. Don't output unless inside html.

The website doesn't need to look identical across browsers, it needs to just look good

Maybe a popup pic with a caption?

My face, a quote OF THE DAY on side or stack vertically
 === Navigation ===

"Hey! This is me! What are you here for?" What do you want out of life...

Make content short and sweet, if they want more, they can go find it

When someone first lands on your website, what do you want their reaction to be?
In awe, curious, NOT overwhelmed

What do we want for navigation?
How is navigation going to work?






Guides:

Resume = Sumary of your professional life
Portfolio = Sumary supported by examples of your projects….

Best Practices for Resume Websites
Code your resume so it can be crawled by search engines.
Offer a button to download your resume in PDF so the hiring manager can add it to your file.
Keep branding consistent between the website and document versions: Use similar fonts, colors, and images so you're easy to recognize.
Be creative and authentic to yourself. Think about the colors, images, and media you want to be a part of your story that you couldn't include in a document resume.

Best Practices for Portfolio Websites
Use mainly visuals. Even if you're showcasing your written work, using logos or other branding is more eye-catching for your visitors.
Don't be afraid to be yourself. Your personality, style, and sense of humor could be what sets you apart from other sites!
Organization is key. If your portfolio is full of photos, logos, and other images, make sure it's easy for visitors to navigate to where they can contact you.
Brand yourself. Choose a logo or icon to make your information easily identifiable.
