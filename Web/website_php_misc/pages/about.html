		Hello, my name is Sean Leapley. I am currently (year math) years old and am working towards a BS in mechanical engineering.  As stated earlier, this website was originally designed as a final project in my web design class. Seeing how well it looked and functioned caused me to make it into a real portfolio and start investing more time into it.

		Feel free to explore my website. True to the logo, I am still very interested in programming and enjoy playing around a bit with 3D modeling programs. While animation does interest me, I am still working on making basic shapes and am nowhere near being able to animate objects yet. On my work page, you can view my digital artwork, websites I created, current programing projects, and perhaps some animations will appear in the near future.

		My skill set primarily revolves around computers, technology, and engineering. When I was in middle school, I made a Lego Technic robot that could swim across my pool in a tupperware container, pick up a large mass of pennies at a low gear ratio, and aim and fire foam darts! It was so much fun to confuse my cats with it. Later, I moved on to designing a very loud and annoying circuit, which I also had fun entertaining my cats with. It was a small round circuit board in which I had soldered on an IC socket where I plugged in a 555 timer chip. The board also had an 8 ohm speaker, some resistors, and 2 capacitors to make some very loud and annoying tones. In high school I wrote my first program in C that was a simple 4 operation calculator. For my senior year I redesigned my high school’s website from the ground up. It hadn't changed in about 10 years and I was up to the task along with a few other students. Shortly after their new website went live, I received an award in “Excellence in Student Achievement in Business and Technology” that currently hangs on my wall. Sadly, other programmers have since taken over the website and my work is no longer visible. However, I still keep a copy on my work page for people to look at.

		During my 4 years in high school I participated in a FIRST (link)  robotics team (FRC) called the "Circuit Breakers". On this team I served as a programmer, problem solver, and a talented mechanic. In those years we went to world championships in St. Louis, Missouri twice. Being part of the team since it was founded and going all the way to championships twice was an amazing experience. Knowing I participated in making that victory possible along with my other teammates still puts a huge smile on my face.

		Some of us have a funny habit of collecting all other team’s buttons we encounter. After 4 years I have amassed a collection of several hundred buttons. They not only show how many teams I have encountered but also how truly large of a program FIRST Robotics really is. Each button represents one whole team. One team usually has 20 - 30 high school students in it along with supportive parents and mentors. Each year every team must make a 120lb competition ready robot in just 6 weeks that is faced with a new challenge every time. My hundreds of buttons only include a very small part of California and a bit from world championships over a span of only 4 years out of the (years) years FIRST has been around. FIRST not only includes the high school Robotics Competition, but also the Tech Challenge (FTC), Lego League (FLL), and Jr. Lego League(Jr FLL). Funny enough FRC has the fewest number of teams across the globe. Most teams are in the United States but FIRST also spans the entire world. I got to shake hands with teams from Beijing, Iraq, Africa, China, Japan, South America, France and more. Being part of the Circuit Breakers from the very beginning has been by far the best experience of my life with other people.

		On this team I learned how to use power tools, program robots, build robots, manage other people, inspire other teams and more. I got to meet with aerospace engineers, software engineers, and mechanical engineers in person! How cool is that? While each of them wanted to help us build the robot super badly, they could only serve as mentors. I now understand their pain because now that I am no longer in high school I am also a mentor. All I can do is help a little where I can because I am no longer a student that can build the robot. I really miss building the robot with my team, but it is time to move on to larger projects and find new teams in college and beyond. I still do visit my team occasionally to see how they are doing and help them when I can.

		These days I continue to learn more about programming and engineering. I am currently building a quadcopter drone, playing around with a raspberry PI, occasionally making websites, learning to design 3D animated characters, creating digital art, repair computers, going to school, and working part time. With a bit of luck along with lots of time and effort, my goal of working with and designing robots that will help make the world a better place.
