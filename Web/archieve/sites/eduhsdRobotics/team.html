				In 2008, the FIRST FRC game was RACK AND ROLL. Torgeir Lindborg, our first Team Captain, went to see the 
				competition at UC Davis, Sacramento with his parents when he was in 8th grade. They found out about the competition 
				through an announcement in the newspaper.
			</div>
			<br />
			<div class="text para">
				Torgeir was inspired and hooked! He sought permission to start an FRC team at his high school when he was a 
				freshman and received it. He looked on the FIRST website to find a team that would mentor us. The Elk Grove 
				Herdinators informed him that it was too late in the year to start his own team, but invited him to join their team for 
				the year. The 2009 FRC competition was LUNACY. Torgeir participated in that competition as a Herdinator and 
				enjoyed the FRC signature...

				As a sophomore at Union Mine High School, Torgeir was able, with the help of the school faculty and his family, 
				to start a district wide FRC Team. Another student, Emma Holm, jumped on board during the summer before the 
				school year to help with fundraising and public relations. Torgeir and Emma began recruiting and discovered another 
				student, Luke Jarrett, who held the vision for a robotics team as well and had been looking for a way to create a team. 
				Word spread and before we knew it our team, the Circuit Breakers, #3189, was 32 students and 11 mentors strong. 
				Currently, we have team members from Union Mine, Oak Ridge, Ponderosa, El Dorado, Shenandoah, and Independence 
				High Schools. We are building a bot, pumped up, and ready for the competition. Go Circuit Breakers!
