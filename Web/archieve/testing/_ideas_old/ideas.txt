People like to scroll...

Have all pages displayed on the first page and have each link just scroll down to one location

each location takes a one full screen height (depending on the persons screen)

clicking each link makes jquery slide effect

the nav bar follows you


upon first scrolling, the navlogo shrinks and the text floats to the right


add option to tiled backgrounds to disable scrolling
types of backgrounds:

full, centered

full stuck to left or right

change scale of tiled and background position for tiled?

image fixed and scale in all corners..this implies height is not 100%

background on sides...both left and right are covered but image clings to middle top or middle bottom...implies height is not 100%



diagnosing problems...option to show all borders
	dialoug box for showing specific tags or classes of borders...when show all borders....make negative padding and border so nothing moves???

each box you can change font size or style...have the website spit out a list of all fonts and add ability to add google fonts to font registry for website



user inputs soundcloud embed

backend downloads mp3 for website and inserts to html code
