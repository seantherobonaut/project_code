my main issue now with css only is nested operation...what if my css module gets nested inside itself?
	...article seen about media queries related to specific elements instead of windowsize only



...central physical unlinked stylesheet
copy css values from unlinked css file into php session variables...insert into document as blockcss in header...with proper formatting?

if session is not active, have a cover, after

On first load, add small delay (unhide upon delay timer or documentready) to perform adapt functions with javascript...
then update changed values to the php session variable that holds css values (javascript functions must be at bottom of page even documentready)

...when editing layout, javascript makes changes and at end of each functions ajax pushes changes to php that writes changes to the unlinked
css file.

???what about javascript copied phpvars intializing before body and executing after element without waiting for document.ready?

console.time("DOMContentLoaded");
      .append("<li>one</li>")
      .append("<li>two</li>")
      .append("<li>three</li>")
      .appendTo("body");	...append directly to html? cool!


=========================================
anti javascript might still work....have jquery measure screen width then subtract combined element width  to figure out how far apart they can be before
they "break" upon that break plus a margin...add a new media query...to be in edit mode, one must enable javascript

forms...jquery was the plan, but server can deny too many requests, people might be able to spam requests hacking javascript anyway...server security
video players, get height and width and make css ajustments when needed

css only background image was already worked out...

what is more commmon? css breaks or people who disable javascript?
