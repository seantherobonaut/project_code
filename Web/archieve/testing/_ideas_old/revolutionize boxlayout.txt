					<div class="dynBox func:stack">

					</div>
<!-- 					test call function.function();

					func() get total children widths and current width...if whitespace < 2 (they can be 1 pixel on some)...execute break
					for dynBox get func:funcname ...obtain class as a string and for each class append to an array only if that 
						classname contains the string "func:" if it does, trim that and add to the array...or just execte...only
						one function per dynbox

					horizontal to vertical - disable vertical align for only immediate child elements
					(one row becomes one column)...children with width:100% and max-width:200px still shrink when stacked as column?

					grid system
					stack how ever man fit in one row and decide how many columns from that -->
