			permissions.... contentstuff->hasPermission(pass in variables that must be set or true)?
			or get back rows if the permissions exist

COMPAT error is special because it is a front end error...only a user can mess that up not the server or coder
if(localhost/compaterror == true)
	set $errors = true
	do not load the redirect meta

for loop missing files
	It takes the contents of a filetree.txt from root directory and loops through it
		if even one file is missing, $errors=true and it pushes all missing files to an array that are displayed in the log file

___________Ignore Below lines______________________________
	

	install script (dev page)
		dev page is displayed when there is no config file
		later, dev page can only be access from password login with url /dev

		checks files
		creates tables
		only runs when the config file does not exist
		grabs db users
		installs permissions and groups maybe from yml or json files

		update permissions

		website accounts vs mysql accounts

	each time a plugin is added or the templates changed, the update or install script can be run agagin

	base install
	update templates
	install plugin


heredoc would allow you tou put all html in classes...and put stuff inside it.

		perhaps make a script to set permissions on all files...with parameters?
			make all files from the webclient no execute or read except index, logout or other action files
			on ftp server, only certain users can read/write code but all can include/execute to not overwrite methods
			Example: globally allow localhost/error.php but localhost/uuwat/debugger.php returns "location forbidden chmod"
				...also all request handlers can be executed ex: localhost/modules/userauthentication/requestLogin.php


	for calling content locations on webpage
	$paragraph = new ReadPara($db, array(34,55,2,31,19,27))...the literal ids of images (serverside)
	$paragraph->item(1)
	$paragraph->item(2)
	$paragraph->item(3)
	$paragraph->itemID(4) 4th item in assoc array called "id=4" in html
	$paragraph->itemData(4) 4th item in assoc array called "texthere"


	all write functions go to ajax? php only reads output?

	have javascript functions subscribe to event handler...upon inserting new data rerender the page but NOT refresh
		*rerender = execute all window resize functions


			lol, make a function that ensures each file has a newline at the end for github

		idea for permissions:
			no permission nodes...each acttion or piece of data will have a seperate table
			that lists groups or conditions that it needs to peform the action. Seperate tables following
			oop design. The only permission "stuff" will be in the permissions table.
