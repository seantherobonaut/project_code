idea:
 have a table of named tamplates that correspond to ids...
	if you a template that shares a subtemplate with a nother template hwo will the user add that
lets say, several templates share the same template of "menu bar"

when the user creates a new page, they could make a new menu bar, or select one existsin..but how?
will they jsut say use template_id:abc or can they select from a list of names they made the correspond to temlate ids?

each template/post must have its own included js file that creates a form that goes inside a common popup
popup:common
buttons:common newbutton(type, id)




TODO don't allow the main template to be nested...
remove the option to delete the template(just use Delete page instead)
