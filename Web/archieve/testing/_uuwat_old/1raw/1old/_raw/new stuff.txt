be sure that all content and their buttons are encased in div to group them together so they do not float off

have the edit content buttons sit below and to the right of all sub-content...
	even if it is a template with just the option to 'delete' have an edit button like facebook	
		this will cause a popup with more options...minimize layout change with picture button
			...or jsut <button>edit</button> use js to toggle popup form


maybe find something to do with the login page...


create the paragraphTableRegister.php
write form to send data to server
write the addParagraphRequestProxy to handle the request

write the delete form
write the deleteParagraphRequestProxy

instead of having a generic not found, have different objects say "no content listed" ...or "missing matching template"
