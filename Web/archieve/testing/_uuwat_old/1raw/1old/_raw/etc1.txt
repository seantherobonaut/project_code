button printed by php (button...targetid...function) unhides an invisible form(is printed with every content)
and sets the form's id
		there is a solid transparent div at z-index:50, then the form at 51
	closing the form, hides the form, and hides the popup


the form uses the button's id to submit an ajax request
depending on successful, either a window alert will come up saying "cannot do this not logged in..etc"
or nothing and change page content using the type and id of the target...
	but in order to do that you need to get html output of that template or post from the server

you might need to alter or make a new requestproxy= path so include autoloader, error handler, etc...
