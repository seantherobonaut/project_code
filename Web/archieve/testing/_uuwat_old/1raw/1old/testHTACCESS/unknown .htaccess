#[NC] means not case sensitive

#The only difference between blocking a single referrer and multiple referrers is the modified [NC, OR] flag in the multiple referrers example, this should be added to every domain except the last.

#You might have noticed the line "Options +FollowSymlinks" above, which is commented with a '#'. Uncomment this line if your server returns a '500 Internal Server' error. This means your server isn't configured with FollowSymLinks in the '' section of the 'httpd.conf'. Contact your system administrator for advice with this issue.



make an errorPages folder what holds error 401, 404, 500, etc...

escape characters
RewriteRule "^search/(.*)$" "/search.php?term=$1" [B,PT]

But you might need to allow encoded slashes because it might have issues
An alternative to this flag is using a RewriteCond to capture against %{THE_REQUEST} which will capture strings in the encoded form.

The [BNP] flag instructs RewriteRule to escape the space character in a backreference to %20 rather than '+'. Useful when the backreference will be used in the path component rather than the query string.


The following rule will forbid .exe files from being downloaded from your server.
RewriteRule "\.exe" "-" [F]
This example uses the "-" syntax for the rewrite target, which means that the requested URI is not modified. There's no reason to rewrite to another URI, if you're going to forbid the request.
When using [F], an [L] is implied - that is, the response is returned immediately, and no further rules are evaluated.


How can we use the H|Handler flag?


[NC] means case sensitive


In the example below, any request for an image file will be proxied to your dedicated image server. The match is case-insensitive, so that .jpg and .JPG files are both acceptable, for example.
RewriteRule "(.*\.(jpg|gif|png))$" "http://images.example.com$1" [P,NC]
