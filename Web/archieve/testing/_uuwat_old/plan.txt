ABSOULTELY NO IMPROVEMENT ON TEMPALTE DESIGN UNTIL BASIC WEBSITE IS COMPLETED!!! SAME WITH ALL OTHER IMPROVEMENTS.
YOU CAN'T IMPROVE ON SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST YET!!!
Manually work with tempaltes. 
NOthing on the website will be changeable other than the data. All template files are manually created.
You may use get parameters to modify page content
_________________________________________________

	when logged in, have an admin bar, with an option to turn off and on edit mode
	when on user can hover on any item that seems like it is editable and it will highlight or change cursor
		or...use can toggle edit highlight mode
	

	//BUG bad TemplateRegisters do not generate log outside of UUWAT

	/*url table
paragraph table
heading table*/
	//TODO enforce a new template naming scheme. Each template folder must contain a file.php that matches its name
	//TODO setup a small database table that uses the $_GET["page"] to find pages and return the filename
	//TODO
	/*
		searchstring 

		update .htaccess
		update FileSearchClass

		Make sure all filenames of base are turned to Base

		lastLocation needs to have the second L capitalized

		Make a find&replace for files
		eventually replace all require_once with class_exist and then require...start putting multiple classes in one file
		Improve efficiency more by using a $_GLOBALS array. Directly calling an array rather than a class and function each time a file loads 
		should be more effient(long term)

		Make it so when you change the appPATH you only have to change it in one location

_________________________________________________

You must still use class files with html snippets to encapsulate data.
Sometimes use require with class_exist()
	
permissons?
universal datatable?

for javascript, have one windowresize event handler that will run everythin inside an array that has been attached so there are no window resize conflicts

wrap all output handlers inside real full HTML dom

make buttons on the handlerOutput pages and practice some ajax

Compat error

you need config with rootPATH, UUWAT, appPATH, dbCONN, crashHANDLER
