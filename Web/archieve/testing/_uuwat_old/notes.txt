instead of using dots . use commas , they are faster in php
rather than using double quotes, use single quotes they are faster (no check for variables in there? test)

pass variables by reference

echo <<<HERE_DOC
My name is "$name". I am printing some $foo->foo.(no need for newline character)
Now, I am printing some {$foo->bar[1]}.
This should print a capital 'A': \x41
HERE_DOC; ...must be by itself with NO indent!

abstraction is key, make a class do one thing, and one thing really well
	redflag when you have to plan around tons of things to get a simple task done


OOP:
try to limit the number of arguments methods have to provide a common interface
apparently, all classfile, abstracts, and interfaces) can only be included once
Extend to abstract classes to specialize them. 
use other classes constructors mainly to input other objects
or in the constructor have the other object instantiated and send it properties

have objects inside classes, write the interfaces first

start making base abstract classes that have properties and methods and abstract methods
so it will be easier to make baseLogger, baseErrorMessage stuff like that It will make modular plugand Play easier
plan out how your classes will work first with interfaces

Second, inheritance is used to SPECIALIZE, not EXTEND with extra functionality. This is the most misunderstood thing in OOP. As a rule of thumb I tend to extend abstract classes only.
... well done inheritance is a specialization of the contracts defined by the super type 

implementation of an object should be completely hidden from the objects that use it

passing variables by reference
