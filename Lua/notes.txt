all variables are global unless specified by local

Table fields - This is a special type of variable that can hold anything except nil including functions.

io.write adds less whitespace to seperate variables as opposed to print()

variable declaration is weird

(you still can have 1 variable per line, but this is called a variable_list)  variable_list = value_list
var1,var2 = value1,value2

-- Swapping of variables
b, a = a, b

logical operators "and" "or" "not"

a..b (concatinates strings a and b)
#variable (returns the length of the string or table)

do while loop is known as "repeat until" in lua
